Problems:

trying to get a button to be displayed in the popover menu
so instead of struggling with that i placed an a tag instead
to form part of a placeholder for when I get the button idea
rectified.

changes code in popover menu from js to python, so that I can store all my code in django db

Busy in context_processors.py file
I push all the info that I needed to the item dectionary
now the next step is to get it to store in a list
and push it to views.py file for templates
