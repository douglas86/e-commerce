Problems:

trying to get a button to be displayed in the popover menu
so instead of struggling with that i placed an a tag instead
to form part of a placeholder for when I get the button idea
rectified.

As soon as I click on the pagination button to ge to next page it 
gives the following errors.
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
then I have to delete the localStorage and the problem will go away
until I click either next or previous.
So I recon that problem counld have something to do with not passing the button tag
to the next page.
